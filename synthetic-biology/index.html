            <p>Biology and computer science what? Yes, Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering. The subject combines various disciplines from within these domains, such as biotechnology, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, systems biology, biophysics, computer engineering and genetic engineering.</p>

<p>Experts predict that within ten years, it will be possible to search for genetic designs on the web, download them to your computer and modify and adapt these to your needs. Yes today, it is possible to decode your DNA for a few thousand dollars. Expect the price to drop to the cost of a regular blood test within five years and, shortly thereafter, a cup of coffee. But this process is not just “reading” DNA. It is now possible to “write” it. Led by Craig Venter of the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), the team of scientists built a synthetic life form — by “writing” DNA. First, they chemically synthesized a bacterial genome, then they used nuclear transfer techniques to transplant the genome into a bacteria. And apparently, the bacteria replicated itself, too.</p>

<p>Cold and flu vaccine designs will be spread quickly over social media and that the process will be as easy as downloading an app on a smartphone. This technology will, ideally, make it possible for us to print our own treatments. What? print our own treatments. The technology that Venter used to “boot up” this new organism was the equivalent of a laser printer that can “print” DNA.</p>

<p>A 3-D printer, as the name indicates prints ink not on a flat substrate, such as paper, but in three dimensions, in successive layers; the ink is substrate and substance in one. Current pricing is by the number of base pairs — the chemical “bits” that make up a gene — to be assembled. Today’s rate is about 30 cents per base pair. Prices are falling exponentially. Within a few years, it could cost a hundredth of this amount. Eventually, like laser printers, DNA printers will be inexpensive home devices. </p>

<p>With internet of things, one of the most exciting areas of focus is now on nanotechnology capable of circulating in the human body.  It is like having a sub-microscopic lab bench on which you can handle cell components, viruses or pieces of DNA. Treating yourself will be like playing a video game where we have to kill viruses or strategies immune system to prevent attacks.</p>

<p>CRISPR, a new genome editing tool, could transform the field of biology. It has the potential to correct genetic mutations and cure life-threatening diseases. While gene editing gives us a way to alter genes that cause diseases there is a huge possibility of its misuse.</p>

<p>All of this opens up a Pandora’s Box of problems. It also means the possibility of terrorists creating biotoxins or virus strains that could be unleashed over large populations. Suppose people died in lakhs due to bio-virus in medicines. They will also be able to create targeted attacks against a single individual based on his or her own unique biology. We will need anti-virus software and defenses just as we have for computer software. But although we can reformat our hard disks to remove a computer virus, we can’t reformat our genomes ... yet. How will it impact you? And what can you do about it? That I believe is the important 'So what' question. So what?  </p>

<p>With these emerging technologies, bioethicists have begun debating the ethics of this technology. Biological systems are extremely complex and changing human genes could have unintended and undesirable consequences. And many bioethicists are not comfortable with the prospect of gene editing for purely cosmetic enhancements, or to give certain people physical and intellectual advantages.</p>

<p>However, it is too late to turn the clock back on these emerging technologies. The genie ( or should I say the gene) is already out of the bottle.</p>
