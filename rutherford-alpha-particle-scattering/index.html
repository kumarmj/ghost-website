            <p>The initial discovery was made by <strong>Hans Geiger</strong> and <strong>Ernest Marsden</strong> in 1909 when they performed the gold foil experiment in collaboration with Rutherford, in which they fired a beam of alpha particles (helium nuclei) at layers of gold leaf only a few atoms thick. At the time of the experiment, the atom was thought to be analogous to a plum pudding (as proposed by J. J. Thomson), with the negative charges (the plums) found throughout a positive sphere (the pudding). If the plum-pudding model were correct, the positive "pudding", being more spread out than in the current model of a concentrated nucleus, would not be able to exert such large columbic forces, and the alpha particles should only be deflected by small angles as they pass through.</p>

<p>However, the intriguing results showed that around 1 in 8000 alpha particles were deflected by very large angles (over 90°), while the rest passed straight through with little or no deflection. From this, Rutherford concluded that the majority of the mass was concentrated in a minute, positively charged region (the nucleus/ central charge) surrounded by electrons. When a (positive) alpha particle approached sufficiently close to the nucleus, it was repelled strongly enough to rebound at high angles. The small size of the nucleus explained the small number of alpha particles that were repelled in this way. Rutherford showed, using the method below, that the size of the nucleus was less than about 10<sup>−14</sup> m.</p>

<ul>
<li>At that time atomic number was not there, they were experimenting on basis of how much more weight from Hydrogen atom. They tried with many Gold, Berilum, etc.</li>
<li>They thought probably it's because of thickness of foil that they got scattering by more than 90<sup>o</sup> that's why they tried to took slim gold foil which should have only few atoms width.</li>
</ul>

<p>They were all doing experiments with one than other, changing width of foil, material of foil and then calculating fraction of alpha particles scattered back.</p>

<ul>
<li>Only 1 from 8000 scattered back, from pudding model none should have scattered so much. Wow, they were worried about 1 being so much scattered, I would have let it slide.</li>
